We have a code repository with the following features:


Project file structure:
- TestRepo/file1.py
- TestRepo/file2.py


Projects files contents summaries:
- File: TestRepo/file1.py

Write an Introduction text for the repository. The Introduction must provide a clear and concise overview of the repository, must have a single paragraph of 10 lines at most and should not mention files that are not related to the main goal of the repository (e.g.: README.md, LICENSE, requirements.txt, configuration files, etc). Add the title to the text. The output must be in markdown text.
