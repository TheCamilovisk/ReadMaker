We have a code repository with the following features:


{files_structure}


{files_summaries}


Write an Introduction text for the repository. The Introduction must provide a clear and concise overview of the repository, must have a single paragraph of 10 lines at most and should not mention files that are not related to the main goal of the repository (e.g.: README.md, LICENSE, requirements.txt, configuration files, etc). Add the title to the text. The output must be in markdown text.
